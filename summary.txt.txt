CoronaTime
Kevin Chen, May Xiao, Andrew Zhu

CoronaTime is a tool that people can use to understand the spread of disease.
It will feature a UI that shows a population of people moving around over time.
Each person will be a certain color to indicate their exposure to the disease -
healthy, sick, or even infected but asymptomatic. There will be parameters that
the user can input in order to modify the behavior of the population and virus,
testing to see how different characteristics impact the spread of disease.
A graph will also be created to characterize the spread of the disease.

Categories:
Implementation Project
Social Networks, in the Schelling Model Visualization
Graph and Graph Algorithms, in the underlying structure to track spread of the virus

May Implemented:
- User input methods
- Translated the paper on Coronavirus Policies to a program implementation
- Developed code that executes 3 different policies on how to handle coronavirus
  - Evolve implements policy by taking into consideration socialDistance
    (socialFrequency), outside contact rates, household contact rates, or no
    contact (quarantine), when determining how people move across the map
  - Created ways to reflect quarantining of individuals and families
- Created a way to run iterations (modifiable) of updating the population with
  the evolve() method and displaying the resulting visualizer
- Created a day counter display in the UI that updates the day for every 12
  loops of evolve(); - this assumes each day has 12 movements available

Kevin Implemented:
- Visualizer based on the Schelling Model, edited with a timelapse view
- Implemented error checking on user inputs
- Went through each class and refactored into helper methods for increased readability

Andrew Implemented:
- Implemented the initialization of the population.
- Implemented the underlying graph structure that represents the spread of
  disease among the population
- Implemented the graph algorithms that calculates the number of connected
  components and tallies edge types.
- Implemented random movement of the population as one of the movement methods
